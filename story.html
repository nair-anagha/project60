       Summer Time Blues Poem
        </h1>

        <p>Summer Break is here and it's time to fear,
            because school time is gone and summer is here
            SummerTime means Moms go Haywire,
            then the circumstances become quite Dire
            SummerTime allows Moms to give Homework and Practice,
            then after some time they make you review your math 
            Tactics
             Now don't you worry there is always a way out,
             Make sure you are calm and don't try to pout
             SummerTime is over, it's time to say Hooray!
             So put on a smile and enjoy your school day
             And remember Summertime is a long time ahead,
             And until then don't think about lying in your bed
